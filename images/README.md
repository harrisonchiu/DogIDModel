# Dog Image Datasets

Udacity dog dataset:\

Oxford pets dataset with bounding boxes:\
`https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/`

Microsoft cats and dogs dataset:\

Stanford dog dataset with bounding boxes:\
`http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/`

Tsinghua dog dataset with bounding boxes:\
For the most part seems like a superset of Stanford dog dataset, except missing a couple pictures for a few breeds\
`https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/ThuDogs/`

Potentially the dog dataset created by [DogID API](https://github.com/harrisonchiu/dogid-api)


Some images may be repeated for each dataset; compare hashes to see when parsing the raw data.

Currently Tsinghua is the main dataset; will add more datasets later
